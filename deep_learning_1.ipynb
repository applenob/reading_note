    "\"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.\" -- Elon Musk, co-chair of OpenAI; co-founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n",
    "Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.\n",
    "The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.\n",
    "Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.\n",

    "笔记也会不断更新，只要在今后在工作中碰到其中的问题需要进一步研究学习，就会继续丰富此笔记的内容。\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "什么是**machine learning**? \n",
    "\n",
    "在原始的AI系统中，定义不同的case使用不同的解决方法，这称为“hard code”。进一步的AI系统需要一种去获取知识的能力，也就是从原始数据中发现模式（“Pattern”），这种能力就是**machine learning**。\n",
    "\n",
    "但是，一般的machine learning算法严重依赖于数据的**表示(representation)**，表示中包含的每份信息又称为**feature**。\n",
    "\n",
    "这又引发了一个新的问题，对于很多task，我们不知道应该提取什么样的特征（只能经验主义）。\n",
    "\n",
    "于是又有了**representation learning**，即使用machine learning不光光是学习reprsentation到output的映射（mapping），还要学习data到representation的映射。\n",
    "\n",
    "典型的表示学习算法是**autoencoder**。encoder函数是将输入数据映射成表示;decoder函数将表示映射回原始数据的格式。\n",
    "\n",
    "representation learning的难点：表示是多种多样的，一种表示学习算法很难覆盖多种层次和不同类型的表示。\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning**：使用多层次的结构，用简单的表示来获取高层的表示。这样，解决了上面的问题（一种方法）。\n",
